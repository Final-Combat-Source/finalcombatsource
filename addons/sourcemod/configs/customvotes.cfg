// How to edit this file: (Not all values will effect every type of vote. Ex: "currentmap" won't change anything in "players" type votes)
//
// "Custom Votes"										<--	Leave this alone
// {													<--	Add all votes after first bracket (Leave this alone)
// 		"Say something funny!"							<--	Name of vote
// 		{
// 			"type"					"list"				<--	Type of vote (Valid types: players, map, list, simple)
//															players - Populates the vote with a list of the online players
//															map - Populates the vote with a list of maps from a specific map list
//															list - Populates the vote with a custom list of choices
//															simple - Doesn't populate the vote with anything
//
//			"vote"					"1"					<-- Determine if a vote is called to determine the result of the selection, or if each selection is chosen  manually by the players
//			"cvar"					"sm_cvar"			<-- Control variable being changed
//
//			"options"									<-- These are your list options
//			{
//				"lol"		"LOL"						<-- Option name: lol | Option result: LOL
//				"rofl"		"ROFL"						<-- Option name: rofl | Option result: ROFL
//			}
//
//			"override"				"sm_lol"			<--	Admin override (Use this with admin_overrides.cfg to prohibit access from specific players)
//			"immunity"				"0"					<--	Admins with equal or higher immunity are removed from the vote
//
//			"delay"					"60"				<-- Delay in seconds before players can cast a selecting after the map has changed
//			"cooldown"				"5"					<-- Delay in seconds before players can vote again after casting a selection
//			"team"					"0"					<-- Restricts players to only casting selections on team members
//			"bots"					"0"					<-- Allows/disallows casting selections on bots
//			"ratio"					"0.6"				<-- Ratio of players required to cast a selection
//			"multiple"				"0"					<-- Allow/disallow players from casting a selection on more than one option
//			"minimum"				"4"					<-- Minimum votes required for the vote to pass (Overrides ratio)
//			"maxcalls"				"3"								<-- Maximum times a player can cast a selection (0 = No Limit)
//			"maxpasses"				"3"								<-- Maximum amount of times the vote can be passed
//			"command"				"sm_csay {OPTION_RESULT}"		<-- Command(s) ran when a vote is passed
//
//			"start_notify"			"Started vote.					<-- Printed to everyone's chat when a player starts a vote
//			"call_notify"			"Voted for {OPTION_NAME}.		<-- Printed to everyone's chat when a player casts a selection
//			"pass_notify"			"Vote passed!"					<-- Printed to everyone's chat when the vote passes
//			"fail_notify"			"Vote failed!"					<-- Printed to everyone's chat when the vote fails to pass
//
//			"maplist"				"default"			<-- List of maps to populate the selection list (See maplist.cfg)
//			"currentmap"			"0"					<-- Allows/disallows casting selections on the current map
//			"recentmaps"			"3"					<-- How many recent maps will be removed from the vote selections
//
//			"chattrigger"			"vote"				<-- Chat trigger to open the vote selections (Do not include ! or / in the trigger)
//		}												<--	Leave this alone
//	}													<--	Leave this alone
//
// Formatting: Remember to add quotes as needed
//
// Place these in command, call_notify, pass_notify to your liking
// {VOTE_AMOUNT} - Amount of votes called for that item
